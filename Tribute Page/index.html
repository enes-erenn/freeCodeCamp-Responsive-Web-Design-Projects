          M. Kemal Ataturk (1881 – 10 November 1938) <br />
          <br />M. Kemal Ataturk was a Turkish field marshal, revolutionary
          statesman, author, and the founding father of the Republic of Turkey,
          serving as its first president from 1923 until his death in 1938. He
          undertook sweeping progressive reforms, which modernized Turkey into a
          secular, industrializing nation. Ideologically a secularist and
          nationalist, his policies and theories became known as Kemalism. Due
          to his military and political accomplishments, Atatürk is regarded as
          one of the most important political leaders of the 20th century.
          <br />
          <br />
          Atatürk came to prominence for his role in securing the Ottoman
          Turkish victory at the Battle of Gallipoli (1915) during World War I.
          Following the defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, he led the
          Turkish National Movement, which resisted mainland Turkey's partition
          among the victorious Allied powers. Establishing a provisional
          government in the present-day Turkish capital Ankara (known in English
          at the time as Angora), he defeated the forces sent by the Allies,
          thus emerging victorious from what was later referred to as the
          Turkish War of Independence. He subsequently proceeded to abolish the
          decrepit Ottoman Empire and proclaimed the foundation of the Turkish
          Republic in its place.
